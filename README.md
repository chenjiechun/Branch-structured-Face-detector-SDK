# Branch-structured-Face-detector-SDK
## Brief description
This face detector is an efficient detector that can obtain higher performance but use less memory. It was developed on the basis of a manuscript titled "Branch-structured detector for fast and robust face detection using asymmetric LBP features". Recently, We have submitted the manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The main contributions of our manuscript are as follows: 
- We designed a branch-structured detector.
- We proposed a pixel-level image feature named Asymmetric LBP feature (ALBP).
- We proposed a method for introducing ALBP features into a branch-structured face detector.
